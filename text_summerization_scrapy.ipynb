      "Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling and parsing. Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.\n"
